FF2014: The Dropoff
===================================

A FF2014 player recommendation generator, The Dropoff is based on the premise that the best player available in a snake draft is the player where the next best at the given position has the highest dropoff in total points. 

Underlying player data is courtesy of Tony Holm's FantasySharks.com and [can be found in a variety of formats here](http://www.fantasysharks.com/apps/Projections/SeasonProjections.php?pos=ALL).

The Dropoff is an [open-source project](http://benbrostoff.github.io/2014/08/17/open-source-everything/) and I welcome pull requests, questions and comments.
